        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Here's some basic information you might want to know:</p>

        <div class="container" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <p class="scroll-box" style="display: inline-block"><strong>Basic Chicken Infromation:</strong> The
                chicken
                <em>(gallus gallus domesticus)</em> is a large, roundish short-winged bird domesticated from the red
                junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8000 years ago. Chickens are mainly raised for food like meat
                and
                eggs,
                while others are kept as pets or even cockfighting. They are common and widespread domestic animals
                with
                a
                total population of over 25 billion as of 2023, with an annual production of over 50 billion birds.
                A
                hen
                bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are also a part of various cultures,
                with
                refrences in folklore, religion, and literature.
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-box" style="display: inline-block"><strong>Introduction to Chicken Breeds:</strong> The
                breed
                of chicken is important to your living space and your environment. It is important to get the
                appropriate
                chicken when buying your new feathered friends. Each chicken is either a heritage breed or a
                hybrid.
                Some
                hybrids, if any of them lay fertilized eggs, will not give you more chickens of the same breed.
                Heritage
                breeds must be from a parent and grandparent stock of breeds recognized by the American Poultry
                Association
                (APA) prior to the mid-20th century. I personally like both heritage and hybrid breeds due to each
                chicken
                breed's unique features and more. Also, chickens are split into two groups based on meat and
                egg
                laying
                birds. As their names suggest, meat birds are birds killed for their meat and therefore have been
                bred to
                be
                larger to hold more meat. Egg laying chickens are chicken breeds who have been bred for
                optimal
                egg laying, whether it be egg laying consistancy, egg color, or for the duration of a hen's laying
                career.

            <p class="scroll-box" style="display: inline-block"><strong>Sour Crop in Chickens:</strong> The crop is
                a
                sac-shaped organ located just above the breast but below the neckline. Sour crop is a fungal
                infection
                of
                the crop. It occurs when the food in the crop begins to ferment. This is the result of a pH
                imbalance
                and
                how this imbalance affects the natural bacteria in a chicken’s crop. Sour crop is usually an
                individual
                case
                ailment. This means that it often only affects a single chicken. However, if a common trigger is
                consumed by
                the whole flock, you may have several cases of sour crop on your hands. For example, if your whole
                flock
                forages on long grasses or consumes moldy feed, they are all prone to getting sour crop. As a quick
                review,
                an altered crop pH level is what allows bad bacteria, or fungus, to proliferate. There are several
                triggers
                that can lead to crop issues in backyard chickens. Many of these triggers not only lead to sour
                crop,
                but
                can also lead to crop impaction. Keep in mind that sour crop and impacted crop can be interrelated,
                with
                one
                condition leading to the other. The easiest way to diagnose sour crop is to see if the crop is
                emptying
                properly. Chickens generally stock up on food throughout the day, then the food slowly gets released
                from
                the crop and digested throughout the night. If you suspect a sour crop issue, do a crop-fullness
                test.
                You
                can do this test for an individual chicken by quarantining it or for your whole flock. Start by
                taking
                away
                the food and water source in the evening. In the morning, feel the crop to see if it feels empty or
                full. An
                empty crop will feel small, flat, and hard. A full crop will be easy to feel and will be squishy and
                soft. A
                fully impacted crop will feel large and hard. A full crop or a hard impacted crop in the morning
                means
                your
                chicken has a crop problem. When checking for sour crop, a full squishy crop accompanied by
                sour-smelling
                breath is a sure sign of sour crop. You may also hear gurgling noises coming from the hen’s crop,
                which
                is
                from the fermentation process. This is how to treat Sour Crop: First, quarantine the hen. Remember
                to
                give
                it a safe, comfortable pen away from the flock. The chicken should not be provided with food and
                water
                at
                this time. The crop is already full and hurridly fermenting its contents. You should also massage
                the
                chicken's crop 3-4 times a day from throat to breast. Also, you should moniter the progress so you
                know
                if
                you nees to contact a vet. Finally, when the chicken makes a recovery with a smaller and less
                squishy
                crop,
                give the hen fresh drinking wate, but wait at least 12 more hours before giving it tiny bits of
                easy-to-digest food. </p>
            <p class="scroll-box" style="display: inline-block"><strong>Mite Infestation in Chickens:</strong>
                Chicken
                mites
                are a common issue for backyard chicken keepers, and understanding their types, treatment, and
                prevention is
                essential for maintaining a healthy flock. Mites are small parasites that can live on chickens or in
                their
                environment, spreading quickly through direct contact or from wild birds. The most common types
                include
                northern fowl mites, red mites, and scaly leg mites, each with unique characteristics and
                preferences.
                Northern fowl mites thrive in cooler climates, while red mites prefer warmth and humidity. Scaly leg
                mites
                burrow under the scales of chickens' feet and legs, causing discomfort and potential damage. Regular
                health
                checks and monitoring for symptoms, such as decreased egg production, raised leg scales, or visible
                parasites, can help identify infestations early. Effective treatment of chicken mites often involves
                a
                combination of natural and chemical approaches. Options include diatomaceous earth, garlic juice
                sprays,
                and
                more potent treatments like permethrin or Spinosad, which target both live mites and their eggs.
                Scaly
                leg
                mites require a specific treatment process, including washing and oiling the legs and applying mite
                sprays.
                The environment must also be treated thoroughly to prevent reinfestation, as mites can survive off
                hosts
                for
                weeks. Coop cleaning, litter replacement, and applying mite treatments to roosts and crevices are
                critical
                steps to eliminate parasites. For severe infestations, chemical treatments may need reapplication to
                address
                newly hatched mites. Preventing mite infestations is key to keeping chickens healthy and
                stress-free.
                Providing dust baths, securing coops from wild birds and rodents, and applying preventive sprays can
                reduce
                the risk of exposure. Quarantining new birds and performing regular health checks are also vital
                measures.
                While mites may bite humans, they cannot survive on them, making the main concern their impact on
                the
                flock.
                By maintaining proper preventive practices and being vigilant about potential signs of infestation,
                chicken
                keepers can ensure their flock remains productive and comfortable.</p>
