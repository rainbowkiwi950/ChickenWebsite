                <p class="scroll-box" style="display: inline-block"><strong>Basic Chicken Infromation:</strong> The
                    chicken
                    <em>(gallus gallus domesticus)</em> is a large, roundish short-winged bird domesticated from the red
                    junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8000 years ago. Chickens are mainly raised for food like meat
                    and
                    eggs,
                    while others are kept as pets or even cockfighting. They are common and widespread domestic animals
                    with
                    a
                    total population of over 25 billion as of 2023, with an annual production of over 50 billion birds.
                    A
                    hen
                    bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are also a part of various cultures,
                    with
                    refrences in folklore, religion, and literature.
                </p>
                <p class="scroll-box" style="display: inline-block"><strong>Introduction to Chicken Breeds:</strong> The
                    breed
                    of chicken is important to your living space and your environment. It is important to get the
                    appropriate
                    chicken when buying your new feathered friends. Each chicken is either a heritage breed or a
                    hybrid.
                    Some
                    hybrids, if any of them lay fertilized eggs, will not give you more chickens of the same breed.
                    Heritage
                    breeds must be from a parent and grandparent stock of breeds recognized by the American Poultry
                    Association
                    (APA) prior to the mid-20th century. I personally like both heritage and hybrid breeds due to each
                    chicken
                    breed's unique features and more. Also, chickens are split into two groups based on meat and
                    egg
                    laying
                    birds. As their names suggest, meat birds are birds killed for their meat and therefore have been bred to
                    be
                    larger to hold more meat. Egg laying chickens are chicken breeds who have been bred for
                    optimal
                    egg laying, whether it be egg laying consistancy, egg color, or for the duration of a hen's laying career.

                <p class="scroll-box" style="display: inline-block"><strong>Sour Crop in Chickens:</strong> The crop is
                    a
                    sac-shaped organ located just above the breast but below the neckline. Sour crop is a fungal
                    infection
                    of
                    the crop. It occurs when the food in the crop begins to ferment. This is the result of a pH
                    imbalance
                    and
                    how this imbalance affects the natural bacteria in a chicken’s crop. Sour crop is usually an
                    individual
                    case
                    ailment. This means that it often only affects a single chicken. However, if a common trigger is
                    consumed by
                    the whole flock, you may have several cases of sour crop on your hands. For example, if your whole
                    flock
                    forages on long grasses or consumes moldy feed, they are all prone to getting sour crop. As a quick
                    review,
                    an altered crop pH level is what allows bad bacteria, or fungus, to proliferate. There are several
                    triggers
                    that can lead to crop issues in backyard chickens. Many of these triggers not only lead to sour
                    crop,
                    but
                    can also lead to crop impaction. Keep in mind that sour crop and impacted crop can be interrelated,
                    with
                    one
                    condition leading to the other. The easiest way to diagnose sour crop is to see if the crop is
                    emptying
                    properly. Chickens generally stock up on food throughout the day, then the food slowly gets released
                    from
                    the crop and digested throughout the night. If you suspect a sour crop issue, do a crop-fullness
                    test.
                    You
                    can do this test for an individual chicken by quarantining it or for your whole flock. Start by
                    taking
                    away
                    the food and water source in the evening. In the morning, feel the crop to see if it feels empty or
                    full. An
                    empty crop will feel small, flat, and hard. A full crop will be easy to feel and will be squishy and
                    soft. A
                    fully impacted crop will feel large and hard. A full crop or a hard impacted crop in the morning
                    means
                    your
                    chicken has a crop problem. When checking for sour crop, a full squishy crop accompanied by
                    sour-smelling
                    breath is a sure sign of sour crop. You may also hear gurgling noises coming from the hen’s crop,
                    which
                    is
                    from the fermentation process. This is how to treat Sour Crop: First, quarantine the hen. Remember
                    to
                    give
                    it a safe, comfortable pen away from the flock. The chicken should not be provided with food and
                    water
                    at
                    this time. The crop is already full and hurridly fermenting its contents. You should also massage
                    the
                    chicken's crop 3-4 times a day from throat to breast. Also, you should moniter the progress so you
                    know
                    if
                    you nees to contact a vet. Finally, when the chicken makes a recovery with a smaller and less
                    squishy
                    crop,
                    give the hen fresh drinking wate, but wait at least 12 more hours before giving it tiny bits of
                    easy-to-digest food. </p>

                    Chicken
                    mites
                    are a common issue for backyard chicken keepers, and understanding their types, treatment, and
                    prevention is
                    essential for maintaining a healthy flock. Mites are small parasites that can live on chickens or in
                    their
                    environment, spreading quickly through direct contact or from wild birds. The most common types
                    include
                    northern fowl mites, red mites, and scaly leg mites, each with unique characteristics and
                    preferences.
                    Northern fowl mites thrive in cooler climates, while red mites prefer warmth and humidity. Scaly leg
                    mites
                    burrow under the scales of chickens' feet and legs, causing discomfort and potential damage. Regular
                    health
                    checks and monitoring for symptoms, such as decreased egg production, raised leg scales, or visible
                    parasites, can help identify infestations early. Effective treatment of chicken mites often involves
                    a
                    combination of natural and chemical approaches. Options include diatomaceous earth, garlic juice
                    sprays,
                    and
                    more potent treatments like permethrin or Spinosad, which target both live mites and their eggs.
                    Scaly
                    leg
                    mites require a specific treatment process, including washing and oiling the legs and applying mite
                    sprays.
                    The environment must also be treated thoroughly to prevent reinfestation, as mites can survive off
                    hosts
                    for
                    weeks. Coop cleaning, litter replacement, and applying mite treatments to roosts and crevices are
                    critical
                    steps to eliminate parasites. For severe infestations, chemical treatments may need reapplication to
                    address
                    newly hatched mites. Preventing mite infestations is key to keeping chickens healthy and
                    stress-free.
                    Providing dust baths, securing coops from wild birds and rodents, and applying preventive sprays can
                    reduce
                    the risk of exposure. Quarantining new birds and performing regular health checks are also vital
                    measures.
                    While mites may bite humans, they cannot survive on them, making the main concern their impact on
                    the
                    flock.
                    By maintaining proper preventive practices and being vigilant about potential signs of infestation,
                    chicken
                    keepers can ensure their flock remains productive and comfortable.</p>
